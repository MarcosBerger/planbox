        <h2>Why open source?</h2>
      </div>
      <p>As an organization and individually, we strive to be good citizens in our home towns of New York City and Philadelphia. All our software work is done as <a href="https://github.com/openplans/">open source</a>, which means everyone benefits from each improvement we make. We welcome participation in our projects and are grateful to everyone for their contributions of code, ideas, and feedback. We help neighborhood organizations get started, providing technical assistance and capacity building. We&#8217;re also a convener and host for events that help advance ideas of progressive, tech-supported planning, including <a href="http://planningcamp.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://planningcamp.org']);">PlanningCamp</a> and <a href="http://transportationcamp.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://transportationcamp.org']);">TransportationCamp</a>. We consider ourselves impartial, informed guides to the exciting world of civic technology.</p>
      <p>We&#8217;re looking forward to public meetings where everyone arrives informed, stays engaged, and leaves happy. We imagine a future where community groups are equipped to collect and make sense of data, running analysis and models in a web browser at the library. We&#8217;re looking to use the enormous power of the personal tech revolution&mdash;social networks, smartphones, open data and more&mdash;to transform how cities are planned, funded, built and operated. In short, weâ€™re on an ambitious mission to make planning more open, more efficient, and more fun.</p>
