Keep Communities Informed and Engaged
* Information about proposed street changes is often hard for residents to find and track.
* Sharing timely, helpful information is challenging for busy planners.
* Being uninformed leads to frustration and unsatisfactory experiences, even for great projects. And unhappy people slow down the public process for everyone.

{% elif not projects.0.public %} {# The user's project is saved, but not public... #}
Looks like you've gotten started on your project! Make sure to finish up and publish it.

**Make sure to send them to the signin page, because if we send them straight to their project and they're not signed in they'll get a 404.**

{% else %} {# The user's project is public... #}
Looks like you've already published your project! **Give some next steps for sharing**
